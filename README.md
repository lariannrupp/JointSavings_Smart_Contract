# JointSavings_Smart_Contract

---

## Purpose
To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. This smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

---

## Technologies

The Solidity version used for this project was pragma solidity ^0.5.0

---

## Installation Guide

Remix IDE can be used from a web browser, so no major installations are required. Simply open the joint_savings.sol file in Remix IDE.

---

## Usage

1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity

2. Compile and Deploy the Contract in the Javascript VM

3. Interact with the Deployed Smart Contract
